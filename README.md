## Autograd in Golang

Achieved 93% correct predictions on MNIST. Not amazing, but shows that the library works. Improving this number will just be a matter of fine tuning the model, which is not the focus of this project.

To Do:
* New tensor implementation that only uses one slice.
* log() and exp() for tensors
* max() and mean() for tensors
* reshaping, slicing, etc for tensors

Long Term:
* print comp graph
* rewrite in Rust
